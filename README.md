# Statistical Evaluation of Medical Tests
 MMath Dissertation Project

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a tool of extensive use to
analyse the discrimination capability of a diagnostic variable in medical studies.
In certain situations, the presence of a covariate related to the diagnostic variable
can increase the discriminating power of the ROC curve. In this report, we
proposed to model the effect of the covariate over the diagnostic variable by
means of location-scale regression models using penalised cubic B-splines. The
method allows for incorporation of more than one covariate in the regression
model for the ROC curve. The proposed model’s performance is examined in a
simulation study. Finally, the report presents an illustration of the method to a
data set concerning diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.
